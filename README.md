## Frontend react template

This is simple template for react frontend that is connected to java backend.

## Template includes examples for:

- Routing
- CRUD operations
- Api functions and hooks
- Shared components
- Production and development URL
- Context state management
- Github pages deployment

## How to run locally:

Clone the project, set `dev` variable in `Users.js` to true, and if you expect to have data available you need to clone backend-template as well and point `@Cross-origin` in `TemplateControler.java` to localhost:3000.

## Further development:

- [x] Create stable frontend infrastructure
- [x] Connect frontend to backend locally
- [x] Create CRUD operations
- [x] Deploy frontend and connect it to backend
- [ ] Add typescript
- [ ] Write tests
